<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>This project aims to optimise marketing campaigns for a sportswear brand in the UK market. I analysed A/B testing results to understand the effectiveness of different ad strategies, including customer segmentation, ad formatting, and platform selection.</p>

<h3 id="data-methodology">Data and Methodology</h3>

<p>The analysis utilises data from an A/B testing experiment conducted on a dataset of 67,085 advertisements. Three key tests were performed:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Customer Segment Optimisation:</strong> Compared ad performance based on targeting specific audience segments (interests, custom audiences, lookalikes) vs. a broader audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Formatting & Interactivity:</strong> Evaluated the effectiveness of video and interactive ads compared to non-video, non-interactive ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Platform Placement:</strong> Analysed the success rate of ads automatically placed by Meta vs. those manually placed by the advertiser.</li>
</ol>
